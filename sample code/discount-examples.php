	/**
	*	This file is an example of how to use the Freestone API by Peach New Media.
	*
	*	This particular example deals with Discounts. 
	* 	Discounts can work on many different levels. For example, coupon level discounts
	*	will take a certain amount off of the full seminar price if the customer enters the coupon code.
	* 	Member level discounts (if allowed by the provider) will automatically reduce the price by a certain 
	*	amount for different member levels (i.e. student, government member, etc.)
